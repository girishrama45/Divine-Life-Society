SWAMI SIVANANDA:
From inadvertence comes delusion, from delusion, egoism, from egoism bondage and all 
the consequent sorrows that one is heir to. Heedlessness is death, freedom from 
heedlessness is immortality. Heedlessness is dangerous because it is the cause of egoism, 
bondage and sorrow. Heedlessness develops as anger and afterwards in the shape of 
delusion. Doubt is rooted in ignorance. It is an obstacle in the spiritual path. It should be 
destroyed by cultivating intense faith. The fear of disaster is worse than disaster itself. The 
fear of a disease is worse than the disease itself. Banish fear from your mind by cultivating 
courage and by meditation on the fearless, immortal Atman.
